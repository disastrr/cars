#THIS IS MY CARS PROJECT

##To run:
- go to cars/api and run `make run`
- go to cars and run `go run main.go`
- the url is [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

##I made a website where you can view car models from the cars api. 
- as the api adds more models, more models show up in the site.

###Hover over the manufacturer name to see more details. 
###If you want more info regarding the specifications, click more info.

// For the bonuses I made advanced searching and comparisons.
- a simple search bar, you can search for manufacturer name, model name, year and category.
- click on the checkboxes of the models you want to compare then click on the compare button.
